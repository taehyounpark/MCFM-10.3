\section{Overview}

\MCFM{} is a parton-level Monte Carlo program that gives \NLO{} and \NNLO{} predictions
for a wide range of processes at hadron colliders. The program has been
developed over a number of years and results have been presented in
a number of published papers.  The papers describing the original
code and the most significant developments in the \NLO{} implementation are:

\end{itemize}
 
As of \textbf{v8.0} \MCFM{} can also compute selected color-singlet processes through \NNLO{} in 
\QCD{}
perturbation theory.  The processes available at this precision, as well as
benchmark numbers, are detailed in Section~\ref{sec:latest}.  When using \MCFM{} 8.0 or newer
for \NNLO{} calculations please refer to:

   C.~Focke, W.~Giele, X.~Liu,~F. Petriello and  C.~Williams, \\
  {\it ``Color singlet production at NNLO in MCFM''},
  arXiv:1605.08011.
\end{itemize}

A significant overhaul of \MCFM{} was undertaken in \textbf{v9.0} of \MCFM{}. If you use
this version or newer please cite
\begin{itemize}
	\item \fullcite{MCFM9}\,.
\end{itemize}

Version \textbf{10.0} includes SCET-based $q_T$ resummation and is called CuTe-MCFM when this
feature is used. When you use the $q_T$ resummation please cite
\begin{itemize}
	\item \fullcite{Becher:2020ugp}\,.
\end{itemize}
The manual for the resummation functionality can be found in \texttt{cute-mcfm.pdf}.

Version \textbf{10.1} includes a C++ interface to many of the 1-loop matrix elements
included in the code. When you use this functionality please cite
\begin{itemize}
	\item \fullcite{Campbell:2021vlt}\,.
\end{itemize}
A guide to the structure of the interface is included in this paper.

Version \textbf{10.2} includes a more complete treatment of color singlet production
processes at NNLO, expecially colour singlet processes involving pairs of bosons.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \fullcite{Campbell:2022gdq}\,.

implementation of specific processes at \NLO{} and \NNLO{}, are listed
in \cref{MCFMrefs}.
