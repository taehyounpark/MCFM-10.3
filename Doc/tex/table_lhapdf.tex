		\texttt{lhapdfset} &
		Specifies the parton distributions used in case the code has been built with
		\texttt{PDFROUTINES = LHAPDF}. For a default global installation the PDFs reside
		in \texttt{/usr/share/LHAPDF/} or \texttt{/usr/local/share/LHAPDF}, and the name
		equals the set name from \url{https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/pdfsets.html}, which is
		also the directory name of the sets. Multiple PDF sets separated by a space can be specified. \\
		\texttt{lhapdfmember} & Specifies the individual members of the parton distribution sets.
		A value of zero corresponds to the central value for Hessian sets. In case multiple sets
		have been specifies above, each one needs a member number separated by space. \\
		\texttt{dopdferrors} & When this is set to \texttt{.true.} PDF uncertainties are calculated
		for every specified \PDF{} set according to the routines provided by \LHAPDF{}.
		The \texttt{lhapdfmember} numbers are ignored but must still be set for each member. \\
