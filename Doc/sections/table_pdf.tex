		This specifies the parton distributions used in the case when the code has been built with
		\texttt{PDFROUTINES = NATIVE}. The choice of parton distribution is made by
		inserting the appropriate 7-character code from Table~\ref{pdlabelrecent}
		or in Tables~\ref{pdlabelmrs} and~\ref{pdlabelcteq} for historical PDF sets.
		As mentioned above, this also sets the value of $\alpha_S(M_Z)$.\\
