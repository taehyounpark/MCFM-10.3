		These parameters represent a basic set of mass cuts that are be applied
		to the calculated cross-section. The only events that contribute to
		the cross-section will have, for example,
		{\tt m34min} $<$ {\tt m34} $<$ {\tt m34max} where {\tt m34} is the
		invariant mass of particles 3 and 4 that are specified by {\tt nproc}.
		{\tt m34min}~$> 0$ is obligatory for processes which can involve a virtual
		photon, such as {\tt nproc=31}. By default, the maximum settings are set to $\sqrt{s}$.\\
