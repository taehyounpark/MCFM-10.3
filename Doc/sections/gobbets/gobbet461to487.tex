\midheading{Diboson+jet production, processes 461--487}
\label{subsec:dibosonjet}

These processes represent the production of a vector boson pair in association
with a jet.  They are the counterparts of the corresponding diboson process
(\texttt{nproc-400}) described above, but also including a jet in the final
state.  They may be computed to NLO.
Amplitudes are taken from refs.~\cite{Campbell:2015hya,Campbell:2016uvh,Campbell:2022qpq}.
