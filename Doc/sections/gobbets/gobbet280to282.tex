\midheading{Direct $\gamma$ production, processes 280--282}
\label{subsec:dirphot}

These processes represent the production a real photon.  Since this
process includes a real photon, the cross section diverges when the
photon is very soft or in the direction of the beam.  Thus in order to
produce sensible results, the input file must supply values for both
{\tt gammptmin} and {\tt gammrapmax}. This will ensure that
the cross section is well-defined.

Currently the code computes this process up to NLO accuracy.  The
extension to NNLO~\cite{Campbell:2016lzl,Campbell:2017dqk,Campbell:2018wfu}
has not yet been made public.
