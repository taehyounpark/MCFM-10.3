\midheading{$W\gamma\gamma$ production, processes 370-371}
\label{subsec:wgamgam}

These processes represent the production of a $W$ boson which subsequently
decays leptonically, in association with two real photons.
Since this process includes real photons, the cross section diverges
when the photon is very soft or in the direction of the beam.
Thus in order to produce sensible results, the input file must supply values for both
{\tt gammptmin} and {\tt gammrapmax}. Moreover, when the parameters {\tt zerowidth}
and {\tt removebr} are set to {\tt .false.} the decay $W \to \ell \nu$ will include
photon radiation from the lepton, so that a non-zero {\tt R(photon,lept)\_min} should
also be supplied. This will ensure that the cross section is well-defined.

These processes may be computed at leading order only.
