\midheading{$c \overline s \to W^+$, processes 361--363}
\label{subsec:csbar}
These processes represent the production of a $W^+$ from a charm and anti-strange
quark at LO. The $W^+$ boson decays into a neutrino and a positron.

The NLO corrections to this LO process include a contribution of the form,
$g\overline s \to W^+ \overline c$. For process {\tt 361} this contribution is
calculated in the approximation $m_c=0$ at NLO. In order to perform the NLO calculation
for a non-zero value of $m_c$, one must instead sum the results of processes {\tt 362}
and {\tt 363} for {\tt part=tota}.
