\midheading{$WZ$~+ $b$~+ jet production, process 255-256 }
These processes represent the production of $W$ and $Z$
bosons in association with two jets, one of which contains a $b$-quark.
This process is only implemented for leptonic decays of the
$W$ and $Z$ particles. The calculation is available at LO only.
