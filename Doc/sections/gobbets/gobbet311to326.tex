\midheading{$W+Q+$~jet production processes 311--326}
\label{subsec:wQj}

These processes represent the production of a $W$
boson that decays leptonically,
in association with a heavy quark, $Q$ and an additional light jet. In
processes {\tt 311} and {\tt 316}, $Q$ is a bottom quark, whilst
processes {\tt 321} and {\tt 326} involve a charm quark.
In these processes the quark $Q$ occurs as parton PDF in the initial state.
The initial state in these processes consists of a light quark and a heavy
quark, with the light quark radiating the $W$ boson. These calculations may
be performed at LO only.

When {\tt removebr} is true, the $W$ boson does not decay.
