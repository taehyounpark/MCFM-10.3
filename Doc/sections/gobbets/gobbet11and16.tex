\midheading{$W+$~jet production, processes 11,16}
\label{subsec:w1jet}
This process is calculable at leading LO and next-to-leading order NLO.
These processes represent the production of a $W$ boson which subsequently
decays leptonically, in association with a single jet.
When {\tt removebr} is true, the $W$ boson does not decay.
