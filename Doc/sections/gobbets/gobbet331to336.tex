\midheading{$W+c+$~jet production, processes 331, 336}
\label{subsec:wcj}

These processes represent the production of a $W$
boson that decays leptonically,
in association with a charm quark and an additional light jet.

In contrast to processes {\tt 321} and {\tt 326} described above, the initial
state in this case consists of two light quarks, one of which is a
strange quark which radiates the $W$ boson. The calculation may
be performed at LO only.

When {\tt removebr} is true, the $W$ boson does not decay.
