\midheading{$t\bar{t}$ production with decay and a gluon, process 143}

This process is only calculable at leading order LO.
This process describes lowest order $t \bar{t}+g$ production
including two leptonic decays $t \to b l \nu$.
When {\tt removebr} is true, the top quarks do not decay.
This LO process only includes radiation in production.
