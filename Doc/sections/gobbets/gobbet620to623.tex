\midheading{Associated production of $ZH$ and a jet, processes 620-623}
These processes represent the production of $Z$ and $H$ bosons in
association with a jet, with various decays of the Higgs boson provided.
They are primarily of interest as a component
part of the NNLO contributions to $ZH$ production.
For further information see ref.~\cite{Campbell:2016jau}.
This process is calculable at leading LO and next-to-leading order NLO.
