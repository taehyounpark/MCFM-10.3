\bottomheading{$WW$+$ZZ$ interfering, process 8211}
This process calculable at leading LO and next-to-leading order NLO.
This process describes a specific final state which is accesible both
from the decay to two $W$'s and two $Z$'s.  The two processes can thus
interfere.

This process has been treated in several papers, \cite{Campbell:1999ah,Campbell:2011bn,Boughezal:2016wmq,Campbell:2022gdq}.
