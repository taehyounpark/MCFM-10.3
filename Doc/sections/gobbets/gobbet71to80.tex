\bottomheading{$WZ$ production, processes 71--80}

This process is calculable at LO,NLO and NNLO and has been treated in several papers, 
\cite{Campbell:1999ah,Campbell:2011bn,Boughezal:2016wmq,Campbell:2022gdq}.
For $WZ$ production, the $W$ is chosen to decay leptonically. The $Z$
(or virtual photon, when appropriate) may decay into electrons ({\tt
nproc=71},{\tt 76}), neutrinos ({\tt nproc=72},{\tt 77}), a pair of
bottom quarks ({\tt nproc=73},{\tt 78}), three generations of
down-type quarks ({\tt nproc=74},{\tt 79}) or two generations of
up-type quarks ({\tt nproc=75},{\tt 80}).  In process {\tt 78} the
mass of the $b$-quark is neglected.  These processes will be observed
in the final state as $W$-boson + two or three jets.  In processes
{\tt 72} and {\tt 77}, a sum is performed over all three species of
neutrinos.

When {\tt removebr} is true in processes {\tt 71} and {\tt 76},
neither the $W$ or the $Z$ boson decays.
