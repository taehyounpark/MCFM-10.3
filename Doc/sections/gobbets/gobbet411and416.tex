\midheading{$W+Q$ production in the 5FNS, processes 411, 416}
\label{subsec:wb5FNS}

These processes represent production of a $W$ boson in association with a
$b$-jet, computed in the 5-flavour number scheme, i.e. a $b$-quark is present in
the initial state. The lowest order processes are the same as in processes {\tt 311}, {\tt 316}.
The results at NLO are not physical cross sections since part of the corrections
are not included in order to avoid double-counting with the 4FNS process (processes
{\tt 401} and {\tt 406}). To obtain combined 4FNS+5FNS predictions, the user
should select process {\tt 421} ($W^+$) or {\tt 426} ($W^-$).
