\midheading{$H + 2$~jet production, $(m_t=\infty)$, processes 270--274}

These processes represent the production of a Standard Model Higgs boson
in association with two jets. The Higgs boson
subsequently decays to either a pair of photons ({\tt nproc=270}), a bottom quark pair ({\tt nproc=271}),
a pair of tau's ({\tt nproc=272}), a pair of leptonically decaying $W$'s ({\tt nproc=273})
or a pair of leptonically decaying $Z$'s ({\tt nproc=274}).

The matrix elements are included in the infinite top mass limit
using the effective Lagrangian approach.

When {\tt removebr} is true, the Higgs boson does not decay.
