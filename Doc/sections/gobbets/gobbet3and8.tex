\midheading{Photon-induced corrections to $W$-boson production, processes 3,8}
\label{subsec:wbosonphoton}

These processes compute the production of
a $W$ boson, (which subsequently decays leptonically),
through the reaction $q + \gamma \to e + \nu + q$.
The calculation must be performed at NLO.
Since the reaction has an initial
photon, it is important to have an accurate parton distribution function for
the photon in the proton, e.g. LUXqed17\_plus\_PDF4LHC15\_nnlo\_30.
