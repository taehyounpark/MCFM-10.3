\midheading{Di-jet production, processes 190--191}
\label{subsec:dijet}

Process {\tt 190} represents di-jet production through strong interactions.
It may be calculated to LO only.

Process {\tt 191} is an ancillary process that is used in the calculation of
weak one-loop corrections to di-jet production.  
This process is calculable at leading LO and next-to-leading order NLO.
When computed at LO it gives the
contribution of weak ($O(\alpha^2)$) and mixed weak-strong ($O(\alpha\alpha_s)$)
mediated processes to di-jet production.  Please refer to Ref.~\cite{Campbell:2016dks} for details.
