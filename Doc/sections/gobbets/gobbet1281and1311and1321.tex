\midheading{$e^- e^+ \nu_e \bar \nu_e$ production, processes 1281, 1311, 1321}

These processes compute cross sections relevant for the final state
$e^- e^+ \nu_e \bar \nu_e$, i.e. with charged leptons and neutrinos
from the same (electron) doublet.  As a result they receive
contributions from diagrams with resonant $ZZ$ propagators and
resonant $WW$ propagators.  Process {\tt 1281} only includes
amplitudes containing a Higgs boson (c.f. processes {\tt 123} and {\tt 128}).
Process {\tt 1321} only includes continuum (box-diagram)
amplitudes (c.f. processes {\tt 127} and {\tt 132}).  Process {\tt 1311}
includes both amplitudes and the effects of the interference
between them (c.f. processes {\tt 126} and {\tt 131}).

%   The effect of
% the interference between the $WW$ and $ZZ$ diagrams can be assessed
% by, for instance, comparing process {\tt 1281} with the sum of
% processes {\tt 123} and one-third of {\tt 128.ELNU}, where the
% weighting is to divide out the natural sum over three neutrin\ o
% flavours in process {\tt 128.ELNU}.
%
% Event generation is not available for these processes at present.
