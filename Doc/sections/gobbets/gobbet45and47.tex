\midheading{$Z+3$~jets production, processes 45, 47}
\label{subsec:z3jets}

These processes represent the production of a $Z$ boson and $3$ jets,
including also the effect of a virtual photon when the $Z$ decays to electrons ({\tt nproc=45}),
but not when it decays to neutrinos. 
The $Z/\gamma^*$ decays to an $e^+ e^-$ pair ({\tt nproc=45}) or into three species of neutrino ({\tt nproc=47}).
The calculation may be performed at LO only.

When {\tt removebr} is true, the $Z$ boson does not decay.
