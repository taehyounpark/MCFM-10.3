\midheading{$W$-boson production, processes 1,6}
\label{subsec:wboson}

These processes represent the production of a $W$ boson which subsequently
decays leptonically. 
This process can be calculated at LO, NLO, and NNLO.
NLO calculations can be performed by dipole subtraction, 
zero-jettiness slicing and $q_T$-slicing.
NNLO calculations can be performed by  zero-jettiness slicing and $q_T$-slicing.

When {\tt removebr} is true, the $W$ boson does not decay.
