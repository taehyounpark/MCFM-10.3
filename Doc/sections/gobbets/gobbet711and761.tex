\bottomheading{$WZ$ with interference, processes 711 and 761}
This process can be calculated at LO, NLO, and NNLO.
NLO calculations can be performed by subtraction, zero-jettiness slicing and $q_T$-slicing.
NNLO calculations can be performed by  zero-jettiness slicing and $q_T$-slicing.

Full account is taken in this process of the interference between diagrams
generated by the exchange of two positrons. This leads to a more complicated resonance
structure in the phase space.
