\midheading{$e^- e^+ \nu \bar \nu$ production, processes 1282, 1312, 1322}

These processes compute cross sections relevant for the final state
$e^- e^+ \nu \bar \nu$, i.e. an electron pair and a sum over all three
flavours of neutrino.  For muon and tau neutrinos, only $ZZ$ diagrams
contribute.  For electron neutrinos there are contributions from
diagrams with resonant $ZZ$ propagators and resonant $WW$ propagators.
Process {\tt 1282} only includes amplitudes containing a Higgs boson
(c.f. processes {\tt 123} and {\tt 128}). Process {\tt 1322} only
includes continuum (box-diagram) amplitudes (c.f. processes {\tt 127}
and {\tt 132}).  Process {\tt 1312} includes both amplitudes and the
effects of the interference between them (c.f. processes {\tt 126} and
{\tt 131}).

% The effect of the interference between the $WW$ and $ZZ$
% diagrams can be assessed by, for instance, comparing process {\tt 1282}
% with the sum of processes {\tt 123} and {\tt 128.ELNU}.
% 
% Event generation is not available for these processes at present.
