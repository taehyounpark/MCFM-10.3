\midheading{$\tau^+\tau^-$ production, process 221}
\label{subsec:tautau}

This process provides predictions for the production of a tau lepton
pair mediated by $\gamma^*/Z$, with subsequent leptonic decays. The
calculation is available at LO only. The relevant matrix elements are
adapted from the ones in ref.~\cite{Kleiss:1988xr}.

When {\tt removebr} is true, the tau leptons do not decay.
