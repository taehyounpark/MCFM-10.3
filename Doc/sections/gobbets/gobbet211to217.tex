\midheading{Higgs production via WBF, processes 211--217}
\label{subsec:wbf}

These processes provide predictions for the production of a Higgs boson in
association with two jets via weak-boson fusion (WBF). The Higgs boson
subsequently decays to either a pair of bottom quarks
(processes {\tt 211, 216}), to a pair of tau's ({\tt 212, 217}),
to a pair of $W$ bosons ({\tt 213}),
to a pair of $Z$ bosons ({\tt 214}),
or to a pair of photons ({\tt 215}).
For more details on this calculation, please see Ref.~\cite{Berger:2004pca}.

Calculations can be performed up to NLO for processes {\tt 211}--{\tt 215}.
In addition to this, processes {\tt 216} and {\tt 217} provide the lowest
order calculation of the WBF reaction which radiates an additional jet.

When {\tt removebr} is true, the Higgs boson does not decay.
