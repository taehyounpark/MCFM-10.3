\bottomheading{Gluonic DM operator, process 804}
804~$GG\to({\chi}(p_3)+\bar{\chi}(p_4)) +f(p_5)$ [Gluonic DM operator] NLO

Process 804 produces the 
mono-jet signature through the following gluon induced operator, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{O}_g&=&\alpha_s\frac{(\chi\overline{\chi})(G^{\mu\nu}_aG_{a,\mu\nu})}{\Lambda^3}~,
\end{eqnarray}
This process is available at NLO. Process 844 represents the
production of DM plus two jets and is available at LO. Since this
operator is higher dimensional, extensions to a theory in which there
is a light mediator requires the definition of two new scales (one for
the EFT in the loop defining the operator). In this version we
therefore do not consider in a theory with a light mediator.
