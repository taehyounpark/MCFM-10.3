\bottomheading{Two jets, gluonic DM operator, process 844}
844~$GG\to({\chi}(p_3)+\bar{\chi}(p_4)) +f(p_5)+f(p_6)$ [Gluonic DM operator]   LO\\

Process 844 represents the
production of DM plus two jets and is available at LO. Since this
operator is higher dimensional, extensions to a theory in which there
is a light mediator requires the definition of two new scales (one for
the EFT in the loop defining the operator). In this version we
therefore do not consider in a theory with a light mediator.
