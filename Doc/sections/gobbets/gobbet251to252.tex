\midheading{$W^+W^++$jets production, processes 251,252}
These processes represent the production of two $W^+$
bosons in association with two (process {\tt 251}) or three (process {\tt 252})
jets.  The lowest order at which two positively charged $W$ bosons
can be produced is with two jets.
This process is only implemented for leptonic decays of the
$W$ particles. The calculation is available at LO only.
The calculation and code are from ref.~\cite{Melia:2010bm}.
{\tt removebr} is not implemented and has no effect.
