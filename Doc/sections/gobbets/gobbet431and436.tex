\midheading{$W+b{\bar b}+$~jet production, processes 431,436}
\label{subsec:wbbjetmassive}

These processes represent the production of a $W$ boson which subsequently
decays leptonically, in association with a $b{\bar b}$ pair and an
additional jet. The effect of the bottom quark mass is included (in contrast to
the massless approximation used in processes {\tt 24}, {\tt 29})
and the calculation may be performed at LO only.

When {\tt removebr} is true, the $W$ boson does not decay.
