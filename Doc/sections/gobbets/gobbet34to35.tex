\midheading{$Z$-boson production decaying to jets, processes 34--35}
Thes processes are calculable at leading LO and next-to-leading order NLO,
{\tt nproc=34} gives $ Z(\to 3\times(d(p_5)+\bar{d}(p_6)))$
and {\tt nproc=35} gives$ Z(\to 2\times(u(p_5)+\bar{u}(p_6)))$.
Radiation from the final state quarks is not included in this process.
