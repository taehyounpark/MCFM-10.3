\midheading{$Z\gamma\gamma j$ and $Z\gamma j j $, 303, 304, 308 and 309}

These processes are available at LO only. The $Z/\gamma^*$ subsequently decays into
either an $e^+ e^-$ pair ({\tt nproc=303,304}) or neutrinos ({\tt nproc=308,309}).
Since these processes include a real photon and a jet, the cross section diverges
when a photon or a jet is very soft or in the direction of the beam.
Thus in order to produce sensible results, the input file must supply values for both
{\tt gammptmin} and {\tt gammrapmax}, and {\tt ptjetmin} and {\tt etajetmax}.
 Moreover, when the parameters {\tt zerowidth}
and {\tt removebr} are set to {\tt .false.} the decay $Z \to e^- e^+$ ({\tt nproc=303, 304})
will include photon radiation from both leptons, so that a non-zero $R(\gamma,\ell)_{min}$
({\tt Rgalmin})
should also be supplied. This will ensure that the cross section is well-defined.
Anomalous couplings are not currently implemented for these processes.

%Processes {\tt 303} and {\tt 308}  represents the production of a $Z$ boson (or virtual photon)
%in association with a two photons and and an additional jet. These processes are available at leading order only.
%These processes do not currently have anomalous couplings implemented.
