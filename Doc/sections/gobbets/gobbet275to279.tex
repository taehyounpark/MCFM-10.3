\midheading{$H + 3$~jet production, ($m_t=\infty$), processes 275-279}

These processes represent the production of a Standard Model Higgs boson
in association with three jets. The Higgs boson
subsequently decays to either a bottom quark pair ({\tt nproc=275}),
or a pair of tau's ({\tt nproc=276})
or a pair of $W$'s that decay leptonically into a single generation of leptons ({\tt nproc=278})
or a pair of $Z$'s that decay leptonically into a single generation of leptons ({\tt nproc=279}).
The matrix elements are included in the infinite top mass limit
using an effective Lagrangian approach. These calculations can be
performed at LO only.

When {\tt removebr} is true, the Higgs boson does not decay.
