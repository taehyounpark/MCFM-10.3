\midheading{EW corrections to $W$-boson production, processes 2,7}
\label{subsec:wbosonew}

These processes compute the electroweak corrections to the production of
a $W$ boson which subsequently decays leptonically.
The electron is taken to be massless.
The electroweak corrections involve both real and virtual corrections.
If particle 5 is present it is a photon.
The calculation must be performed at NLO, i.e.~{\tt part=nlo}.
