		{\tt aii} &
		A double precision variable which can be used to
		limit the kinematic range for the subtraction of initial-initial dipoles
		as suggested by Trocsanyi and Nagy~\cite{Nagy:2003tz}.   
		The value {\tt aii=1} corresponds 
		to standard Catani-Seymour subtraction.\\

		A double precision variable which can be used to
		limit the kinematic range for the subtraction of initial-final dipoles
		as suggested by Trocsanyi and Nagy~\cite{Nagy:2003tz}.
