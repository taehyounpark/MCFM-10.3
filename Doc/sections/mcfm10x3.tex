\begin{itemize}
\item 
Calculation of Z production at N$^3$LO fixed-order through $q_T$ subtractions and resummation at 
the level of N$^4$LL. These calculations include the Z+jet process at NNLO using jettiness 
subtractions. Based on Ref.\cite{Neumann:2022lft}. Detailed documentation can be found in 
Section~\ref{n3losec}.

\item
Jet veto resummation added for color singlet final states, achieving
partial {\mbox{N$^3$LL}} accuracy, as described in Ref.~\cite{CENS}.
Vetoing energetic jet activity is a crucial tool for suppressing
backgrounds and enabling new physics searches at the LHC, but the
introduction of a veto scale can introduce large logarithms that may
need to be resummed.  We present an implementation of jet-veto
resummation for color-singlet processes at the level of N$^3$LL$_p$
matched to fixed-order NNLO predictions.  Resummation is
implemented for vetos of jet activity in productions of a single
boson, such as $Z/\gamma^*$, $W^\pm$ or $H$, or of a pair of vector
bosons, such as $W^+W^-$, $W^\pm Z$ or $ZZ$.  The implementation
relies on recent calculations of the soft and beam functions in the
presence of a jet veto over all rapidities, with jets defined using a
sequential recombination algorithm with jet radius $R$.  However one
of the ingredients that is required to reach full {N$^3$LL} accuracy is
only known approximately, hence N$^{3}$LL$_p$.

Benchmark results, taken from Ref.~\cite{CENS}, are
detailed in Section~\ref{jetvetosec}.
