The external requirements for (CuTe-)MCFM are
  - cmake (>= 3.13)
  - gcc/g++/gfortran (>= 7)

Optional external dependencies:
  - LHAPDF (6.2.X)
  - MPI implementation (We recommend OpenMPI) or Coarrays implementation

To compile with default options just run "cmake .." in the Bin directory or a
new "build" directory, then run make to compile the MCFM program. If you
compile in a directory different than "Bin", please run "make install" to copy
some required files over from the Bin directory. The Bin directory contains
several example input files that can be used as an argument to mcfm.

The following parameters can be added to choose a custom compiler. For example
with MPI the wrapper mpifort will have to be chosen as the Fortran compiler:
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-8
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-8
    -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran-8

Thus to compile at Fermilab on the Wilson cluster (wc.fnal.gov):-
cd MCFM-10.3/Bin/
cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++  ..
make -j

On the lxplus machine at CERN (lxplus.cern.ch):-
cd MCFM-10.3/Bin/
cmake3 -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++  ..
make -j

The following parameter specifies the use of LHAPDF (internal, external):
    -Duse_internal_lhapdf=ON (default)
and can be set to OFF to link against an external LHAPDF library.

When an external LHAPDF is used, cmake might not find the library. A library
search path can be added with -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local, for example.
Additionally, the LHAPDF include path can be set with
-Dlhapdf_include_path=/usr/local/include if it deviates from a standard
location.

For the bundled LHAPDF, PDF sets go into the directory Bin/PDFs. This
installation includes the central PDF members of CT14nnlo and
NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118 with their resummation grids. Additional PDFs can be
downloaded from https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/pdfsets.html and untar'ed in the
PDFs directory.

Additional PDF directories can be added to the LHAPDF search path by using
    export LHAPDF_DATA_PATH=/usr/local/share/LHAPDF
for example.

The following flag enables MPI:
    -Duse_mpi=ON

Alternatively also a Fortran Coarray implementation can be used with:
    -Duse_coarray=ON
This option experimental and cannot be used together with MPI.

The processes WW,WZ and ZZ at NNLO require compilation of the VVamp amplitudes,
which is about 100MB of additional sourcecode and adds significant additional
compilation time. The following flag disables these amplitudes:
    -Dwith_vvamp=OFF

For most recent installation information, process information and
troubleshooting see https://mcfm.fnal.gov. The documents Docs/cute-mcfm.pdf and
Docs/manual.pdf also provide further information but are superseded by the
online documentation. The document cute-mcfm.pdf includes a quick-start guide
with information regarding the resummation features and implementation.
