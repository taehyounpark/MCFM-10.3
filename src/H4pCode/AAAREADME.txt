The purpose of the files in this directory is the calculation of the one-loop amplitudes
for the process
	p + p -> h + 2 jets

in the HEFT (mt -> \infty limit).  It represents the work performed in the following
paper, which contains references to all the original amplitude calculations that are
implemented in this directory.
