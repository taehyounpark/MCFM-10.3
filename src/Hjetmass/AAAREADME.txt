The purpose of the files in this directory is the NLO calculation of the process
	p + p -> H + jet

in the full Standard Model, accounting for loops of top quarks.
The 2-loop matrix elements are not included exactly, but instead treated
as an expansion either in powers of 1/mt or in the high-energy limit.
