This directory contains routines for the calculation of amplitudes
representing the process:

pi + pj -> h + pk + pl

where pi, pj, pk, pl are all possible combinations of q, q~ and g.

The main steering routines are:

gg_hgg_mass_nodecay.f         (top quark loop only)
gg_hgg_mass_tb_nodecay.f      (top and bottom quarks in the loop)

Both routines allow for the possibility of a Yukawa coupling that is
not equal to the mass circulating in the loop.

The routines representing the essential amplitudes for this process:

hgggg_mass
haqgg_mass
haqaq_mass

(and their _tb extensions) take the spinor products za, zb as arguments.
The amplitudes will be computed with the same precision as that of
the spinor products (quad precision or double precision).  The spinor
products of a given precision can themselves be computed by supplying
the routine spinoru (defined in the module 'spinor' in this directory) 
with a momentum array of the same precision.
